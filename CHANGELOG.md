# Changelog

## 1.0.0: The Professional Pass

### Added
- **Advancements**: a tree of 12 milestones, from *The Tether Knows* to *The Wanderer's Account*.
- **Creative tab** "Extreme Dimensions" with every item.
- **Item tooltips** for all mod items, and fuel values on every anchor fuel.
- **Config file** `config/extremedimensions.json` with every balance value.
- **Tether Marks**: penalties shown as cards beside the inventory, with runes, stacks, time left and lore on hover.
- New mod icon from the key art.
- Audio feedback (a low note) when an action is refused, now that on-screen messages are gone.

### Changed
- **One visual style** for the HUD, the anchor screen, the penalty cards, the journal and the Tether Marks.
- The **journal** is now a two-page book spread.
- The **expedition timer** is a framed panel with the dimension, time, distance and drain.
- **Every player has their own time** in shared anchors; a death beyond the wound only costs that player's time.
- The physical tether lies on the ground wherever you walk. It snaps beyond 5 blocks in the Overworld and vanishes
  on a safe return or a death.
- All text is translatable.
- Rarity colours on items.
- The server code is split into focused subsystems (anchor, expedition, tether, penalty, journal, network).

### Removed
- On-screen text notifications. Feedback comes through the HUD, animations, particles and sound.
- The full-screen portal transition.

### Fixed
- Tether chain segments were invisible on 26.3 (block displays take the block as a plain id there).
